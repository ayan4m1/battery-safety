### Observations

The problem with this pack is its discharge leads. They are 16ga PVC jacketed wire. It would not be safe to draw more than ~20A from this pack even if it could deliver because the wire would be melting. Unless you are looking for a low-current purpose or are willing to open the pack up and re-wire it yourself, that alone should disqualify it from purchase.

I ran the 2A test and was surprised to find that I got almost 1550mAh out of it. I was even more surprised when I got 1606mAh out of it at 9A continuous.

Ultimately, I cannot recommend that anyone purchase this battery, because there is no way to safely test it anywhere near its discharge rating.
