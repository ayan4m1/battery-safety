### Test Results

![Test Results](../images/tests/revolectrix-3s-1550.png)

Test results yield an average of 1400mAh per pack. Accordingly, I assert that these packs are roughly 10% over-rated with respect to capacity.

### Observations

The packs tested heated to ~25&deg;C and swelled visibly after a minute at 10A constant discharge.
