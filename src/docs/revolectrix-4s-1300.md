Continuous discharge testing yield an average of 1200mAh per pack. Accordingly, I assert that these packs are roughly 8% over-rated with respect to capcity.

At MTL wattages, these packs were able to deliver 1290mAh - within the margin of error for my testing setup. However, at 75/150W they were closer to 1150mAh.

### Observations

These packs handle 10A continuous discharge well, no observed swelling and only a 4-5&deg;C temperature increase. Unfortunately, I will have to update this when I can test at >10A.
