### Observations

Both test packs I have are roughly 3 x 3 x 2 mm larger than stated, measured fresh out of the box. They averaged 1450mAh across the continuous discharge and vaping profile tests. Accordingly, I find that these packs are roughly 8% over-rated with respect to capacity. At higher discharge rates, the packs did heat up roughly 10&deg;C, but they stayed at safe temperatures up to 12A continuous discharge.
